#### To-do list:
I really want to add more styling to the HTML using Bootstrap.<br>
I also need to fix some of my end-to-end tests, a couple of them are still failing, and I would like to play around with it more to figure out how I can fix those tests.

```
git clone https://github.com/dZazulak/Project1.git
