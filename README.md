Expense Reimbursement System 

## Project Description
This application implements an expense reimbursement system for a company. Employees are able to create reimbursement requests and view their current reimbursements. Managers are able to view past/pending reimbursements, as well as approve/deny reimbursements while leaving a message for the employee.

## Technologies Used
Python - version 3.0
Postgres SQL - version 9.6
JavaScript - version ES2021

## Features
Employees are able to login and submit reimbursements.
Managers are able to approve/deny reimbursements.
Managers are able to leave comments on the reimbursement stating a reason why they have been approved/denied.

### To-do list:
I really want to add more styling to the HTML using Bootstrap.
I also need to fix some of my end-to-end tests, a couple of them are still failing, and I would like to play around with it more to figure out how I can fix those tests.

## Getting Started
You may install the code using the git clone command below:
> git clone https://github.com/dZazulak/Project1.git
